    {question}
    <span className="ml-4 transform group-open:rotate-180 transition-transform duration-300">+</span>
  </summary>
  <div className="pb-4 text-text-muted">{answer}</div>
</details>
```

FAQ content (6 questions covering both services):
1. "How many social media platforms can you manage?" - Depends on package, Starter=1, Standard=2, Premium=3
2. "What kind of content do you create?" - Custom graphics, captions, hashtag strategy, brand voice alignment
3. "Do I need to provide content ideas?" - No, we handle content strategy but welcome your input
4. "How long does website design take?" - Typically 4-6 weeks from kickoff to launch
5. "Can you work with my existing website?" - Yes, maintenance services work with any platform
6. "What if I need both social media and website services?" - Bundle pricing available, ask for custom quote
