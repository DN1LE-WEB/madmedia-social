<objective>
Build the About page featuring Julie and Contact page with Formspree form integration.

Purpose: The About page humanizes the brand by featuring Julie with warmth and personality. The Contact page provides the primary conversion action - form submissions to madmedia56256@gmail.com via Formspree. Both pages complete the core site structure.

Output: Complete About page at /about with Julie bio, and Contact page at /contact with working form submission.

The contact form requires a Formspree form ID to receive submissions.

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://formspree.io and create an account (or log in)
2. Click "New Form" and name it "MadMedia Contact"
3. Set the recipient email to: madmedia56256@gmail.com
4. Copy the 8-character form ID (looks like "xpwajlob")
5. Create `.env.local` file in project root with:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_ID=your_form_id_here
   ```
6. Restart the dev server after creating .env.local

**Note:** Free tier allows 50 submissions/month which should be sufficient for initial launch.
